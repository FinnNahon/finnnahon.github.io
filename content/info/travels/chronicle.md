## 4/12/2024

Caught our 6pm flight from Melbourne Airport to Denpasar Airport, and got into our hotel, Adi Dharma Hotel Legian, at around 11pm. Afterwards, we went on a walk to Kuta Beach but decided to re-route home shortly after as it was late and we were tired.

## 5/12/2024

I rose early and went for a morning swim in our hotels pool. We then went and grabbed a bite to eat at Warung Kampung Indonesian Restaurant (a warung is a type of small family business in Indonesia) and had a nice breakfast before heading back to our room to regroup. We then had a dip in the hotels pool, grabbed a cocktail and generally tried to relax. We then decided to head to Seminyak Beach to visit FINNS, a popular beach club. Spent a while there before heading back to Kuta by catching out first ever motorbike ride! Both myself and Jade sat on the back of the Grab driver's bike and zoomed through Seminyak and Kuta to get back home. After getting back, we decided to start hitting up a few bars on one of the main streets. We ended up visiting BROTHER CLUB BALI before quickly leaving to dip into another bar called Espresso Bar Reborn which had a local band covering mostly rock and metal songs, including System of a Down and AC/DC. We then decided to call it a night, and went back to our hotel before sleeping.

## 6/12/2024

Had to be up at 10.30am to get ready to check out and had a quick breakfast at Nasi Bali before hobbing in a grab car that drove us through down the island to our new hotel in Uluwatu, Uluwatu Made Guesthouse. It was at least an hours drive as there was a lot of traffic, but we got to take in the landscape of the island which was interesting. After relaxing for a bit, we walked to a restaurant called The JoGlow and had some beer and food - I had the spicy squid. Cute little place. Afterwards, we decided to make the walk to Savaya Bali to see why it has been called the 'best club in Asia'. It was certainly a lot classier than FINNS, and had a pretty incredible view overlooking the ocean. We spent a good few hours here swimming and drinking, and then finally dancing in the main DJ square after we felt confident enough. Still, it was a pretty quiet night at Savaya and there was maybe a total of 40 other people there. Then we caught a motorbike back home, and hopped in the pool and throw a soccer ball back and forth between us.

## 7/12/2024

Had an admittedly slow start to the day as Jade was feeling a bit unwell. I took this opportunity to get some fried rice and a papaya juice from our hotel. Afterwards, I had a dip in the pool and started getting ready for us to potentially leave the hotel. We walked to the nearby town in our pants as we were anticipating going to the Uluwatu Temple, and stopped to grab some Nasi Campur (for myself) and Goro-Goro (for Jade). It was very hot and both of us had sweated through the clothes we were wearing, and decided to route back home. We got changed there and learnt that the temple gives you a sarong when you arrive so our pant wearing efforts were a bit silly. We then caught a motorbike each to Uluwatu Temple and saw all the grey long-tailed macaques (a type of monkey) sitting around at the temple - they appear quite intelligent and apparently have even learnt how to barter? Saw some incredible views at the cliff-face and then went to the 7pm Kecek Dance show, a traditional type of Hindu Balinese dance that was developed in the '30s. The story performed was, and is often, based on the Ramayana. Afterwards, we grabbed some food and then headed back home for an early night, falling asleep at 10pm.

## 8/12/2024

Went to Padang Padang beach (which featured in Eat, Pray, Love) and had a swim. It was a cute beach, but quite cramped. Afterwards, walked through the town before heading back to our homestay.

## 9/12/2024

Hopped in a Grab and made our way to our hostel in Ubud called WW Backpackers.

This was a bit of an admin day, and we decided to and do our laundry at a nearby laundromat, and whilst our clothes were washing we went to the Bintang Supermarket to pick up some supplies - just some basics like sunscreen and bug spray. After we had finished up our admin bits, we were back at the hostel about to leave to the Sacred Monkey Sanctuary, only for the hostel owner to suggest we don't as a tree had fallen in the last few hours and sadly killed two tourists and injured another. Me and Jade looked at each other thinking 'what if we didn't decided to do laundry'?

Instead, we walked to Ubud Palace and had a little look around, but it was honestly quite small and there were many tourists doing their usual photo-ops so we left shortly after.

## 10/12/2024

Went out to a bar called the Blue Door, where there was an American man MCing the live band that was performing, often singling out the tourists in the crowd and asking where they're from. I got singled out myself and after having 'Aussie, aussie, aussie' chanted at me, I let out a very lacklustre 'oi oi oi' which got me mocked by the host (and rightly so). The band played a few more random covers, including an amusing cover of Eiffel 65's 'Blue (Da Be Dee)'. Decided to hop next door to No Mas Bar to check our their 'alt rock' night, which was covers of RHCP, Sting and a few other classic rock numbers. Went back to the Blue Door to see what the deal with the 'blue door' was (at 9pm the namesake's door opens up) and suddenly we had a mini dancefloor on our hands. However, Jade and I were just in our group of two and most groups weren't that receptive to having us dance with them. We eventually won this one couple over and we danced a few songs with them. Afterwards, we made our way back to our hostel for a sleep.

## 11/12/2024

Went for a hike up the Campuhan Ridge walk which eventually turned into a regular street road, but with rice paddies on either side. It was an interesting little 'taste' of how sebak works in Bali, and we saw a few farmers tending to their fields with their sickles. Went to a bar called Jungle Fish which was a lot pricier than we expected, and the pool unfortunately required a minimum spend to use so we ultimately didn't go for a dip. Walked back to the hostel, played some card games, then chatted to a friendly hostel roomie called Nils. After seeing on the Hostelworld app that a few other travellers were planning to meet up at a bar nearby, we decided to make an appearance at the 'Why Not' bar. There we met about 10 other travellers, and we got on particularly well with two Mexicans called Mely and Gianpa. After watching some live music at the Why Not bar, we decided to move to LOL Bar, but ended up ducking into CP Lounge, where we danced to reggaeton for most of the evening. I got closer with Mely and we were often dancing together and chatting and I was surprisingly making her laugh a lot. We moved to the Blue Door Bar and danced more in there, and I decided to lean in and kiss Mely. She kissed me back and we were pretty close for the rest of the evening. After the bar shut at 3 we slowly walked back to our hostel. I stayed in front with Mely and Jade hung back with Gianpa, and eventually we reached our impasse and had to bid each other adieu (not without exchanging details, of course). Felt pretty ecstatic with how things had gone with Mely, but am a little sad she had to leave this morning to go to the Gili Islands. Hopefully she'll be back soon and we can see each other once more.

## 12/12/2024

Took it easy today as we were feeling tired.

## 13/12/2024

Today we went on a big tour of the following places/experiences:
- Tegallalang Ricefields
- Tegenungan Waterfall
- A Kopi Luwak tasting
- Pura Tirta Empul (Water Temple)

After the big day, we went out for some drinks and pool at a place called LOL Bar. They were having a reggae night which was just the vibe I wanted. We then went to the Why Not Bar again to meet two other travellers from our hostel for drinks. Chatted for a little bit, watched the live band, then they left and Jade and I decided to hit up The Blue Door and No Mas. Both were not quite what we wanted, so we went back to LOL Bar and played some pool with the locals.

## 14/12/2024

Today we checked out of our hostel in Ubud and booked a Grab car to the town of Medewi, a small beach town. We checked in to Medewi Secret SurfCamp.

## 15/12/2024

Spent the morning surfing, then had a bite to eat, then had a massage down by the beach. Had an early dinner with someone from the Secret SurfCamp called Amy. Had half a kilo of fresh lobster that had been caught **that day** for only $25 AUD.

## 16/12/2024

Had Ryan from SecretSurf Camp drive us down to Canggu, where we checked into the Black Pearl Hostel. After arriving, made plans to meet up with Gianpa and Mely who were also in town. Mely showed up to the beachside bar we were at but Gianpa was at some sushi joint studying, so we decided shortly to make our way to have some sushi for dinner. We shared 4 plates of various sushi rolls, and then walked less than 30 seconds to a bar called Revolver for some further drinks. Had a fun time chatting, and then Mely had to leave around 10pm to go to work.

## 17/12/2024

We met up with Mely and Gianpa at NEGRITA Cafe near both of our accomodation, and had an easy breakfast, before catching a Grab car to Tanah Lot. Once we got there, we had a look at the temple from a few viewing points, but were not able to get closer as the tide was too high. We went up to another point to view Tanah Lot and had a few beers overlooking the temple and chatting. We then walked further down a little path that opened up to a big green space that was perfect for viewing the temple. Got a couple of snaps, and then once we were back down in the main area, the water had receded enough that we were able to cross through the water to the temple. We were then blessed by the locals - we washed our hands and face with some running water, then had a water blessing splashed on our head, a flower placed behind our ear, and some rice placed on our forehead. Ended up being worth travelling this way to the temple. We then decided to head back, and we hopped in a Grab, but Gianpa had accidentally put in an address in Kuta and so a 30 minute car trip ended up taking 1.5 hours. It was not all bad though as Mely was tired and so she put her head on my shoulder and had a sleep. Funny how I could go on many dates back in Melbourne and not feel any strong feelings for months, but one little gesture from her like this and I am ecstatic. Makes life worth living.

We made our way to the beach for sunset and had some food - I have a margarita pizza. Something simple. We chatted for a while, then moved to another close by bar facing the ocean and chatted further there. Jade and Gianpa grew tired and decided to leave, but Mely and I wanted to stick around to keep talking - it appears even a small amount of coffee gives her a lot of energy. We chatted plenty, kissed and held hands, and then at some point decided to move to another bar - we wound up at a Mexican themed bar where I learn more about who she was as a person - growing up she was obsessed with ice skating, her father isn't an affectionate man, she's happier now than she has ever been and in a good space. She would possibly want kids but only if with the right person, and that she doesn't completely connect with the traditional way of living life (in the way of career, house, kids). We disagreed about certain aspects of patriotism as I had mentioned I didn't like how schools forced kids to give a pledge of allegiance (as I had been forced to do whilst living in Ohio, USA), whereas she thought it was a good thing. I like a lot of things about Mely, but the way she looks at you whilst you're talking makes you feel amazing. Her laugh is infectious and her voice is both delicately feminine but also has a sultry weight to it. She knows what she likes and wants and is very sure of herself. It's admirable.

Eventually we had to call it, and I walked her back to her homestay, but we ended up making out on the street which prompted many cars to beep at us. We moved further in, out of the view of the street, and it was hard to separate. Eventually we had to and I slowly moved her waist away from mine and told her to 'get out of here'. She laughed, walked inside and I made my way home.

## 18/12/2024

Got up, went and dropped off our dirty clothes to be cleaned and then Jade and I met up with Mely at The Barn, a British style pub, to have a drink and play some pool. Showed Mely the ropes of how to play the game. After, we needed to pick up our laundry so we went and did that whilst Mely went to meet Gianpa at the B Work Coworking Space where he was working. After laundry, we made our way to the coworking space and we all played some table tennis together before deciding to make our way to the beach to find a place to sit and eat. Decided on a spot in Canggu beach that was facing the ocean, and we chatted there for a while. I got a 15-pc platter of sashimi, but was honestly very keen to get into the water.

Mely and I went and sat in some chairs in the sand watching the sunset whilst Jade and Gianpa stayed back at the table. We had a few chats and some kisses, and it honestly felt quite magical. We then got changed into our bathers so we could have a little dip before it got too dark. Walking into the water, the locals expressed a little concern but we told them we were only going to dip our toes. The water was intense, and the waves stronger than they look, and we were definitely thrown around a bit. Mely did notwant to get her hair wet but nature had other plans. Jade joined us in the waves and we floated around for a while.

After, me and Mely found a beach shower hidden behind where we were eating and washed the sand off of us. It felt strangely intimate sharing a shower together, even though we had only kissed. It felt natural and easy. She grabbed my face as I was under the running water and she said she liked my beard. We then rejoined Jade and Gianpa and we decided to walk along beach and settled on going to Old Man's, a large bar/club near the beach. We saw a bit of the beer pong competition that was going on, had some drinks, then decided to hop into the dancing area for a few hours. After Mely grew tired, I walked her back to her homestay whilst Jade and Gianpa stuck around. We talked some more, kissed some more, then we had to say goodbye. A difficult goodbye for me as I knew I wasn't going to see her for a long while. I think she's had more of an effect on me than vice-versa, as she has been travelling for over 2.5 years and is used to the transitory nature of travel, whilst I am only two weeks in and a little caught up in the magic what-ifs of this short-lived relationship. We did agree to meet again in Asia later in 2025, as she wants to travel here again after visiting her family in Mexico - and obviously Jade and I will be around. Farewell Mely.

## 19/12/2024

Ryan from Secret SurfCamp came and picked us up in Canggu and we began the long drive up to the Gilimanuk Harbour to catch the ferry across from Bali to Java. Got there sooner than expected, hopped on the ferry and after an hour we had touched ground on the most populous island in Indonesia. Got a grab to pick us up and take us to our homestay in Banyuwangi, a place called the Banana Homestay. We were pretty tired so we took it easy, had some dinner out, picked up some snacks and DEET from the supermarket, and came back to rest.

## 20/12/2024

Woke up surprisingly early today and decided to get some work done on my website. Checked out at 11.30am and both Jade and myself have decided to take it slow as we are preparing for our 13 hour bus trip at 4.55pm that will be taking us to Yogyakarta.

# 21/12/2024

The bus journey was long and arduous and quite uncomfortable. The bus would stop constantly for more stops and other travellers would get on, as well as local sellers selling their food and knick-knacks. The bus had no bathroom so we had to use the bathroom at the stops - but no worries, it has a smoking section at the back! I held the bus up once by taking too long in the bathroom, much to the dismay of Jade who had to apologise to the people on the bus. I also had a cigarette in the back of the bus and got locked in as the handle wasn't working properly, and attempted to have a conversation with a local man who couldn't speak English. It was a cool bus ride when you were looking out the window as the other buses passing by would have their funny custom lights on - a common one was the front lights looking like blinking eyes. After getting off the bus, we made our way to our accom in Yogyakarta and setup camp.

After setting up camp, we went out to the main street in Yogya (called Malioboro) and found a local street food joint that was cooking food in the open-air. Jade had suggested this place as he found it in a video he was watching and it was quite yum! I ended up having some kind of turmeric noodle soup. We then checked out a place that had a lot of old Indonesian artifacts, as well as a multi-room horror scene that we walked through that was honestly quite spooky. 

# 22/12/2024

Sadly we had to leave Yogyakarta this day (due to time constraints) and we hopped on a 6-hour train to Jakarta, which was an absolute breeze compared to our bus trip earlier. It was nice to see the local landscape during this trip. We then arrived in Jakarta, and made our way to our hostel. I attempted to find us some dinner nearby down some dark alleys but sadly the place we wanted was closed so we wound up going elsewhere.

# 23/12/2024

We went to Taman Mini today, which was an unreal place that has sections devoted to each region of Indonesia. We took the cable car first, checked out the Komodo dragons (as well as crocodiles, snakes, and more) and visited the Disneyland-esque fairytale castle they had which was run-down. We decided to navigate around it and climbed up some stairs and we weren't even sure if we were allowed to be there. Nonetheless we did this and got some funny pictures. We also went into their admittedly impressive bird enclosure and saw some insane looking animals - including some very regal pigeons.

In the evening, we became friends with a German woman called Aimee in the smokers section of our hostel, and we were served some shots of gin and vodka by someone who worked at the hostel. He decided to take myself, Jade and Aimee to the Chinatown section of Jakarta, where old Chinese people were singing what appeared to be Chinese oldies. They wanted us to get up and perform but we were far too sober and shy to give it a crack. When that shut, we went to another karaoke place and did karaoke there with the locals, and Jade sang 99 Luftballoons with Aimee.

# 24/12/2024

Today we didn't get up to a lot - grabbed some food in the morning, walked around a bit but we were mostly gettign ready to catch our flight that evening to Singapore. We then did catch the flight, which was pretty easy all things considered, and crossed in Christmas Day whilst on the flight. We then made our way to our hostel in the old town of Singapore (on Joo Chiat Road). We walked the streets to find some food but didn't have much luck, but noticed that a lot of the places on our street were karaoke places.

# 25/12/2024

On our first proper day in Singapore, we became friends with one of the workers at our hostel called Zym and organised a plan in the evening to do some karaoke. He said the karaoke on our street is mainly for locals and they've got some strange buy-drinks-for-girls setup so we organised to go somewhere in the city. We went for a walk in the evening to the main street in Singapore to see the Christmas lights and caught a Ecuadorian band playing Christmas tunes with their traditional flute instruments. We then went to karaoke which was OK but the drinks were very expensive, and the karaoke ended up costing somewhere around the value of $80, easily making it the most expensive karaoke I've ever been to. Merry Christmas, I suppose.

# 26/12/2024

Today we checked out Gardens by the Bay, and walked along the 'treetops' of the metal trees, as well as visited the Cloud Forest. We could also see the Marina Bay Sands building in the background but did not visit. We were impressed by the trains, which are completely autonomous and have no driver. You can see through the front of the carriage to view the tunnel approaching.

# 27/12/2024

We visited the Singapore Zoo and checked out all the animals they had on offer, including elephants, chimps, baboons, giraffes and more. Standard zoo fare really, but an impressive place in its scope.

# 28/12/2024

Today was the day we were leaving for Hong Kong, so we mostly got ready to leave and made our way to the airport. Whilst there, we walked around the airport as it is apparently one of the best in the world. They have a huge mall in the middle with a large circular waterfall, as well as a butterfly enclosure. After landing in Hong Kong, we made our way to our hostel, checked in, then got some food nearby. We were perplexed by the porcelain bowls we were handed when we ordered some beer, but quickly learned its a traditional way to drink there as you put it in the bowl. We then wanted to have a drink, so we went to a bar nearby called Bar East, a small smoky bar that had karaoke and darts. The people working there were very happy to see us, and chatted to us excitedly in broken English.

# 29/12/2024

We walked around Hong Kong, taking in the sights and streets of the city. We walked through Hong Kong Park, then made our way to a dai pai dong to eat some local food. The place was very cool, and you could see the chefs cooking outside on their extremely hot woks at a quick pace for their multiple customers.

# 30/12/2024

The Peak

# 31/12/2024

Today was the day for New Years. First, we checked into our new hotel room in the Chungking Mansions which was an experience. As expected, our room was quite small and not very well put together, but hey! It was not that bad. Our 'reception' was in another part of the building (in part A) and our room was in section D. 

We then decided to head out to make our way to the bay to watch the fireworks, which was incredibly difficult as you can imagine. 7 million people all trying to do the same thing. We brought a bunch of alcohol that we got at 7-11 thankfully. We were cordoned off into different sections as a crowd, and slowly moved in closer and closer to the bay. It took a good 1-2 hours just to get close, and by the end we couldn't even really see them as our view was obstructed by a building. It was still a fun time in the crowd, and we had this one woman basically go through the crowd with us as she appeared to be on her own. If a spot opened up, she would say 'go go go' for us to push through.

After the fireworks, I really needed to go to the bathroom so I was desperate and ran up some malls stairs (that were off) and waited in line for a toilet that was in a room that was clearly only meant for mall staff. I was jumping around waiting to go in. After finally making it in, I declared it the best piss of my life.

We then made our way to Lan Kwai Fong (LKF) which was absolutely PUMPING with people, and quite hectic. I was quite drunk at this point and a little overwhelmed by it all, and trying to meet up with a group of travellers in HK. We went to Maggie Choo's briefly, had a little dance, then left to go find our people somewhere else, but with no luck. We drank a beer drinks at some of the other bars, but I wasn't in the best mood as I couldn't find the group, and I found some of the people in LKF obnoxious. Eventually, we called it at like 5am and made our way back to the Chungking Mansions.

# 01/01/2025

We woke up very hungover from New Years in our room in the Chungking Mansions, and decided to have an easy day. We played Donkey Kong Country on the little TV in the corner and chilled out.

# 02/01/2025

Jade and I moved to our new hostel today as our time in the Chungking Mansions was up. An easy move all up.

I met up with someone called Yamis who is a local Hongkonger and we met at a bookshop called Book Punch. Felt comfortable with her pretty quickly, then made our way to a cool bar nearby called Bound. Turns out she's a fan of the bar, and she knows some of the people there. We then had a few cigarettes and drinks and talked about life in Hong Kong, Melbourne, music, et al. and then decided to go for a walk through the streets. She would point out certain things about the buildings and life in Hong Kong. She would note the neon signs that are 'real' and 'fake' (I assume is based on LCD vs gas powered) and she noted that for all the people that hang their clothes outside on the clothesline - they really do just hope it doesn't fall. We then got a late night coffee, which I ordered in Cantonese with the encouragement of Yamis. We then had to say goodbye eventually, and I left her around 2-3am to catch a late night bus back home.

# 03/01/2025

Today we went to Tim Ho Wan's, a place known for its yum cha, and had some dishes with our tea. I had chicken legs for the first time - they weren't too bad, a bit chewy and a little annoying to eat, but the taste itself is fine. We also had dumplings, of course. I then went to go to M+ museum with someone called Amy and saw the I. M. Pai exhibit (as well as the regular exhibits) and had a nice time. Afterwards, I met up with Jade and we made our way to a restaurant in Lan Kwai Fong. Had some abalone and misread the menu so ended up paying quite a bit for it - makes sense, as it is normally expensive. Jade and I then went to meet up with Yamis at a club called Minh Club, a cool smaller club that had an alternative feel to it. We got admittedly quite drunk, and I went outside with Yamis regularly to the street, where we kissed. Jade soon joined us after the club closed, and we went for a walk along the streets. Yamis was quite drunk and making fun of Jade, hiding behind me and then calling him 'weird'. She was going a bit turbo, and she kept biting him and pushing him, which was very funny to watch. We eventually made our way to the trams which had begun running again as it was around 5am in the morning. I gave Yamis a kiss goodbye and Jade and I made our way back to the hostel.

# 04/01/2025

 We then went to a bar called Kowloon Taproom and had a few beers watching the Chelsea v Crystal Palace game which sadly ended in a 1-1 draw. We met up with Yamis again this evening and she took us to a restaurant on Temple Street called 'Spicy Crab', where we ordered a multitude of dishes. This included some kind of congealed blood soup, garlic-chilli-prawns, battered fish and a Hong Kong version of what seemed to be pork chops. Jade then left us and Yamis took me to the riverside near the M+ museum and we looked at the Hong Kong skyline whilst we kissed and talked. She was sad I had to leave, and said she 'shouldn't know me' but is happy she did. We then walked a long distance to the late night bus to my hostel, and she accompanied me there, allowing me to attempt to sleep on her shoulder as was quite tired. We got to the front of my hostel, and we shared a final kiss goodbye.

# 05/01/2025

Went and met up with someone called Heart who was from the Philippines and we checked out a few cool bars, including Bar Leone. I was impressed with the martini I had there - little did I know it is considered the 2nd best bar in the world? I stayed the night with her, then made my way back to the hostel in the early morning.

# 20/01/2025

Went and visited the Giant Goose Pagoda and walked around the gardens surrounding it, in what was a relatively relaxing today. Packed up our things and left for our overnight train from Xi'an Railway Station that was leaving at 9pm.

# 21/01/2025

Arrived in Shanghai at midday after our arduous overnight train which was not relaxing to say the least. We managed to check in to our hostel, then went and grabbed some easy noodles before returning to our hostel to wash some clothes and take a well-deserved nap.
