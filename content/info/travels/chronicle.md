Caught our 6pm flight from Melbourne Airport to Denpasar Airport, and got into our hotel, Adi Dharma Hotel Legian, at around 11pm. Afterwards, we went on a walk to Kuta Beach but decided to re-route home shortly after as it was late and we were tired.

I rose early and went for a morning swim in our hotels pool. We then went and grabbed a bite to eat at Warung Kampung Indonesian Restaurant (a warung is a type of small family business in Indonesia) and had a nice breakfast before heading back to our room to regroup. We then had a dip in the hotels pool, grabbed a cocktail and generally tried to relax. We then decided to head to Seminyak Beach to visit FINNS, a popular beach club. Spent a while there before heading back to Kuta and hitting up a few bars on one of the main streets. We ended up visiting BROTHER CLUB BALI before quickly leaving to dip into another bar called Espresso Bar Reborn which had a local band covering mostly rock and metal songs, including System of a Down and AC/DC. We then decided to call it a night, and went back to our hotel before sleeping.

Had to be up at 10.30am to get ready to check out and had a quick breakfast at Nasi Bali before hobbing in a grab car that drove us through down the island to our new hotel in Uluwatu, Uluwatu Made Guesthouse. It was at least an hours drive as there was a lot of traffic, but we got to take in the landscape of the island which was interesting.
