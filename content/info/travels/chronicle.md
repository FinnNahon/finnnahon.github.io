Caught our 6pm flight from Melbourne Airport to Denpasar Airport, and got into our hotel, Adi Dharma Hotel Legian, at around 11pm. Afterwards, we went on a walk to Kuta Beach but decided to re-route home shortly after as it was late and we were tired.

I rose early and went for a morning swim in our hotels pool. We then went and grabbed a bite to eat at Warung Kampung Indonesian Restaurant (a warung is a type of small family business in Indonesia) and had a nice breakfast before heading back to our room to regroup. We then had a dip in the hotels pool, grabbed a cocktail and generally tried to relax. We then decided to head to Seminyak Beach to visit FINNS, a popular beach club. Spent a while there before heading back to Kuta by catching out first ever motorbike ride! Both myself and Jade sat on the back of the Grab driver's bike and zoomed through Seminyak and Kuta to get back home. After getting back, we decided to start hitting up a few bars on one of the main streets. We ended up visiting BROTHER CLUB BALI before quickly leaving to dip into another bar called Espresso Bar Reborn which had a local band covering mostly rock and metal songs, including System of a Down and AC/DC. We then decided to call it a night, and went back to our hotel before sleeping.

Had to be up at 10.30am to get ready to check out and had a quick breakfast at Nasi Bali before hobbing in a grab car that drove us through down the island to our new hotel in Uluwatu, Uluwatu Made Guesthouse. It was at least an hours drive as there was a lot of traffic, but we got to take in the landscape of the island which was interesting. After relaxing for a bit, we walked to a restaurant called The JoGlow and had some beer and food - I had the spicy squid. Cute little place. Afterwards, we decided to make the walk to Savaya Bali to see why it has been called the 'best club in Asia'. It was certainly a lot classier than FINNS, and had a pretty incredible view overlooking the ocean. We spent a good few hours here swimming and drinking, and then finally dancing in the main DJ square after we felt confident enough. Still, it was a pretty quiet night at Savaya and there was maybe a total of 40 other people there. Then we caught a motorbike back home, and hopped in the pool and throw a soccer ball back and forth between us.

Had an admittedly slow start to the day as Jade was feeling a bit unwell. I took this opportunity to get some fried rice and a papaya juice from our hotel. Afterwards, I had a dip in the pool and started getting ready for us to potentially leave the hotel. We walked to the nearby town in our pants as we were anticipating going to the Uluwatu Temple, and stopped to grab some Nasi Campur (for myself) and Goro-Goro (for Jade). It was very hot and both of us had sweated through the clothes we were wearing, and decided to route back home. We got changed there and learnt that the temple gives you a sarong when you arrive so our pant wearing efforts were a bit silly. We then caught a motorbike each to Uluwatu Temple and saw all the grey long-tailed macaques (a type of monkey) sitting around at the temple - they appear quite intelligent and apparently have even learnt how to barter? Saw some incredible views at the cliff-face and then went to the 7pm Kecek Dance show, a traditional type of Hindu Balinese dance that was developed in the '30s. The story performed was, and is often, based on the Ramayana. Afterwards, we grabbed some food and then headed back home for an early night, falling asleep at 10pm.
