# one bag philosophy

As the name implies, this philosophy is about travelling with a single carry-on sized bag that focuses on essential items only. 

This way you can move about without being weighed down by any excess. I will be following this process throughout my journey.

## general practices

- Travel light
- Don't pack your fears
- Only bring about a weeks worth of items
- Try to fit everything into a bag that is 25L-40L in size

## my personal one bag

My will be packing the following in my bag of choice, the **Osprey Fairview 40L** (I could've gone with the Farpoint, but opted for the Fairview as I was able to get it for about $100 less). 

I should also note that due to my camera setup, I'm bringing more than most suggest.
