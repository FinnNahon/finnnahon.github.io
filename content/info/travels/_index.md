# travels

I am travelling for a year across Asia, the Middle East and possibly Africa. I started in December, 2024.

I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to do this, as many of the places Iâ€™m visiting are ones where people rarely have the chance to leave. 

I would like to engage with each countries individual cultures and get a feel for how the locals live.

I am also travelling with my good friend Jade.

Let's see what it brings.
