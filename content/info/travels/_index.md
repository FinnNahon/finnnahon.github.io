# travels

Starting in early December, I will be travelling across Asia, the Middle East and possibly Africa.

After initially planning a multi-continent trip for 2020, which was postponed for obvious reasons, I'm due to fly out of Melbourne and kick off the journey off in Bali, Indonesia. I have a one-way ticket, and I'm not sure when this journey will finish or where I will end up.

I’d like to note I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to do this, as many of the places I’m visiting are ones where people rarely have the chance to leave. I would like to engage with each countries individual cultures and get a feel for how the locals live. Broaden my horizons and all that.

I will also be travelling with my close friend Jade - we travelled for 3 months throughout Europe back in 2015 when we were 20 years old so it's a little overdue. Something tells me this trip will provide a lot more culture shock than the relatively familiar terrain of France or the UK. It will also be a lot more grueling, as we're travelling for a solid *year*. Bring it on.<br><br>
