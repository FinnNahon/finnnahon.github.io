# travels

Starting in December, I will be travelling across Asia, the Middle East and possibly Africa.

After initially planning a multi-continent trip for 2020, which was postponed for obvious reasons, I'm due to fly out of Melbourne and kick off the journey off in Bali, Indonesia. I have a one-way ticket, and I'm not sure when this journey will finish or where I will end up.

I’m very fortunate to have the opportunity to do this, as many of the places I’m visiting are ones where people rarely have the chance to leave.
