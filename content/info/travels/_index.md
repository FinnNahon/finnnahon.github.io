# travels

I am travelling for a year across Asia, the Middle East and possibly Africa.

After initially planning a multi-continent trip for 2020, which was postponed for obvious reasons, I've flown out of Melbourne and kicked off my journey off in Bali, Indonesia. I have a one-way ticket, and I'm not sure where I will end up.

I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to do this, as many of the places Iâ€™m visiting are ones where people rarely have the chance to leave. I would like to engage with each countries individual cultures and get a feel for how the locals live.

I am travelling with my close friend Jade. We previously travelled for 3 months throughout Europe in 2015 when we were 20 years old so it's a little overdue. Something tells me this trip will provide a lot more culture shock than the relatively familiar terrain of Europe, though. It will also be a lot more grueling, as we're travelling for a solid *year.* Bring it on.
