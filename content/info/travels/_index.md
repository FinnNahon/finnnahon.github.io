Starting in December, I will be travelling across Asia, the Middle East and possibly Africa.

This move has been years in the making, and it very well may be the most meaningful trip of my lifetime.

After initially planning a multi-continent trip for 2020, which was postponed for obvious reasons, I'm due to fly out of Melbourne and kick off the journey off in Bali, Indonesia. I have a one-way ticket, and I'm not sure when this journey will end or where I will end up.

I’m also acutely aware that I’m very fortunate to have the opportunity to do this, as many of the places I’m visiting are ones where people rarely have the chance to leave.

You can see the rough potential trajectory of the trip below:
