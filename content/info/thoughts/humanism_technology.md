# <span style="color: yellow;">humanism is not at odds with technology</span>

Like many, I often find myself associating modern technology with negative practices, be it social media, invasive advertising, electronic waste, privacy concerns - I could go on.

It is easy to get caught up in these systems that are eroding our way of life, but I want to focus on the positive impacts of technology for a bit.
