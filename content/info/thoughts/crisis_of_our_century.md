# <span style="color: yellow;">the crisis of our century</span>

The largest crisis we face as a human race, global warming, is something that creeps up on you. 

It's not immediately obvious in your day-to-day life, yet we can all feel its presence. We all swear this year was warmer than the last, yet a collective feeling of denial persists. 

We'll be alright.

Hold on, my friends family just had to evacuate their home because of a bushfire.

Why is there another shortage of fruit at the shop?

I could've sworn there were more birds around when I was growing up.
