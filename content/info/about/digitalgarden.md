**single plot** serves as my <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html" style="background-color: lightgreen; color: black; text-decoration: none;">digital garden</a>.

While it may sound like a flowery attempt to rebrand blogging, the concept is straightforward: a digital garden is a space where ideas are sown, nurtured, and refined over time. This particular plot is mine, and I prefer to let it grow a bit wild.

## origin

Digital gardens have been quietly cultivated by people in the corners of the internet for some time.

One of the earliest mentions of this concept appears in <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html" style="background-color: yellow; color: black; text-decoration: none;">Hypertext Gardens</a>, a 1998 essay by Mark Bernstein. In it, Bernstein waxes poetic about the joy of freely exploring the internet, harking back to an era when online navigation wasn't confined to a handful of major tech platforms. He draws a compelling analogy:

> “Gardens … lie between farmland and wilderness," says Mark, "The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity."

More recently, Mike Caulfield, a research scientist at the University of Washington, explored this concept in his 2015 essay <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/" style="background-color: yellow; color: black; text-decoration: none;">The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral</a> —a piece well worth reading for the curious.

Caulfield argues that we've become entangled in digital <span style="background-color: cyan; color: black;">streams</span>, exemplified by social media. These streams are conversational and ephemeral, presenting themselves as serialized timelines of events that form narratives. Unlike gardens, they're not designed for revisiting or meandering exploration.

A digital garden offers a respite from the constant stream of online information, allowing for more personal and intimate exploration. I invite you to wander through, take your time, and discover what grows here.
