I've been trying to read more this year.

I'm currently reading *Ghosts Of My Life* by Mark Fisher.

If you have any suggestions, send them my way.

**A few books I've enjoyed this year:**
- Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead — Olga Tokarczuk
- Things Fall Apart — Chinua Achebe
- Slaughterhouse-Five — Kurt Vonnegut
- The Hours — Michael Cunningham
- The Old Man and the Sea - Ernest Hemingway

**My backlog:**
- I Am a Strange Loop — Douglas Hofstadter
- The Plains — Gerald Murnane
