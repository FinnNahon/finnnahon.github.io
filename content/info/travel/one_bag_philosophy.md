Onebagging is about travelling with only a single carry-on sized bag. It is about experiencing the place you're visiting without being weighed down by any excess.

## general practices

- Travel light
- Don't pack your fears
- Only bring about a weeks worth of items
- Try to fit everything into a bag that is 25L-40L in size

## my personal one bag

The following is what I will be packing in my bag of choice, the **Osprey Fairview 40L** (I could've gone with the Farpoint, but opted for the Fairview as I was able to get it for $100 cheaper). I should also note that due to my camera setup, I'm bringing more than most suggest.
