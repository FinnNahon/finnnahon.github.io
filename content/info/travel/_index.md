# travel

I will be travelling across Asia, the Middle East and Africa, starting in December.

This move has been <span style="background-color: #FF7074;">4 years</span> in the making, and it very well may be the most meaningful trip of my lifetime.

After initially planning a multi-continent trip for 2020, which was postponed for obvious reasons, I'm due to fly out of **Melbourne** and kick the journey off in **Bali, Indonesia.** I have a one-way ticket, and am not sure when this journey will end, or where I will end up. 

I’m aware that I’m fortunate to have the opportunity to do this, as many of the places I’m visiting are ones where people rarely have the chance to leave.

You can see the *very* rough trajectory of the trip below:
