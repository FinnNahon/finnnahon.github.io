# one bag philosophy

Onebagging is about travelling/living out of one carry-on sized bag. It is about better experiencing the place you're visiting by avoiding being weighed down by any excess. This means only bringing the essentials that you need to move about comfortably and efficiently.

{{< hint info >}}
Whilst this means something different from one person to the next, typically backpackers who travel like a snail with their house on their back do not fit this approach.

# general practices

- Pack light
- Don't pack your fears
- Only bring about a weeks worth of items
- Do your laundry along the way
- Try to fit everything into a bag that is 25L-40L in size
- Do you really need more than two pairs of pants?

# my personal one bag

The following is what I will be packing in my bag of choice, the **Osprey Fairview 40L** (I could've gone with the Farpoint, but opted for the Fairview as I was able to get it for $100 cheaper).
