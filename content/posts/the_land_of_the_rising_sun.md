Our next stop, Japan, has been particularly pleasant as Jade and I got to meet up with our friends Maxi and Oscar to travel around the country together. 

After our relatively isolating visit to China, it has been nice to catch up with some old friends. Like many tourists, we're starting in the metropolis of Tokyo.

## tokyo

The streets here are plastered in various displays and Japanese typography, which lends itself to a particularly appealing look that many others are a fan of. There's something both stragely chaotic and purposeful about it all.

For all its cleanliness, Tokyo's Kabukicho area is certainly one of the messiest. Maybe that's why the fire department showed up.

One evening, we went to the top of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building to get a view of the city skyline.

I should also note that I had the best bowl of ramen I've **ever had in my life** at Sugoi Niboshi Ramen Nagi. Sad I didn't get pictures of it.

### omoide yokocho

I took a little trip to see a very touristy laneway called Omoide Yokocho. It has a lot of charm and is a good spot to get a quick bite to eat. I wound up having soba noodles.

These photos wound up being far too underexposed as I was trying to compensate for the lighting. So forgive their darkness.

### shibuya crossing

Like any good first-time Tokyo tourist, we checked out the famous Shibuya Crossing.

### sumo wrestling

Oscar and Maxi managed to pick us all up some tickets to a sumo wrestling all-stars tournament at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan arena.

### harajuku

I didn't get any pictures of the incredibly well dressed people of Harajuku, but I did get a few pics of some other things.

### sword museum

We also visited the Japanese Sword Museum.

## myoko

We made our way to Myoko to meet up with Alex who was working at a ski lodge up in the mountains for the ski season. It got cold real quick.

### skiing

I should note I had never skiied in my life before.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/ski_shoes_small.jpg" "width" "ski shoes" "The ski shoes were maybe a little too tight. Better to be safe than sorry." >}}

Shortly after picking up our gear, we popped on our skiis and lined up for the ski lift, only for us to realise we didn't even know how to stand up. After a very awkward balancing act, we managed to get onto the lift and get to the top of the slope.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/jade_alex_and_alesha_skiing_small.jpg" "alesha alex and jade" "alt" "Alesha, Alex and Jade." >}}

None of us knew how to ski so this was pretty much a trial-by-fire experience. After getting the handle on basic turns and making the diamond slow down shape, me and Oscar picked it up fairly quickly. Jade and Maxi took a little longer to get it down.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/jade_skiing_small.jpg" "width" "jade skiing" "Jade hittin' the slopes." >}}
{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/jade_stacking_small.jpg" "width" "jade skiing" "Jade hittin' the slopes." >}}

After feeling confident in moving slowly, myself and Oscar began moving a little faster down the slopes. This.. this was fun.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/oscar_skiing_small.jpg" "width" "oscar skiing" "Oscar was a natural." >}}
{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/oscar_skiing_landscape_2_small.jpg" "width" "oscar" "Check out that view!" >}}

After getting to the bottom of the slope with everyone, myself and Oscar decided to quickly get back to the top for another run before the slope closed for the day. We managed to get down to the bottom without so much as a scratch.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/skiing_selfie_small.jpg" "width" "ski selfie" "Obligatory selfie." >}}

The second day of skiing, however, was a little tougher. It was snowing a lot heavier, and Jade and Maxi decided to sit this one out. Myself and Oscar decided to tackle the course and after we popped up we realised we could not see very far ahead of us.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/snowstorm_small.jpg" "width" "snowy" "The second day was much more arduous." >}}
{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/snowed_in_selfie_small.jpg" "width" "selfie" "Another obligatory selfie." >}}

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/snowstorm_2_small.jpg" "width" "snowy landscape" "If it weren't for all the other skiiers, this place would be eerie." >}}

I didn't fully anticipate how physically exhausting skiing would be, and by the end my legs were made out of jelly. There were even a few moments during one of my runs that I had to pull over to the side to give my legs some reprieve.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/snowstorm_4_small.jpg" "width" "snowy path" "I think.. that's the path to follow?" >}}

Oscar and I had also attempted a slope assuming it was a 'green' slope (meaning easy), but after struggling for a part of the slope and many falls, we started to suspect it wasn't as easy as we thought. After we got to the end, we found out it was a red slope and certainly not intended for us beginners. 

I could feel a little sense of pride that we'd managed to tackle a level beyond beginner, though. I'll certainly return to ski again.

### snowy days

The snow in Myoko was the thickest snow I've ever seen in my life. Not that I've seen much.

## kyoto

After skiing for a few days, we made it to the cultural capital - Kyoto.

### fushimi inari-taisha

We visited the Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine, one of the most visually famous landmarks of Japan with its endless stretch of orange coloured gates.

{{< photo "japan/kyoto/fushimi_inari_tunnel_3_small.jpg" "width" "fushimi inari" "Oscar and Maxi." >}}

### kiyomizu-dera

This temple is what I most keen to see in Kyoto. The Kiyomizu-dera Buddhist temple is from 778 CE and is notable for not using an entire nail in its entire structure.

### ryoanji zen garden

One morning, I went and visited one of Japan's most famous zen gardens, known for its kare-sunsui or 'dry landscape', where rock formations are positioned amongst finely raked pebbles. This is meant to facilitate meditation. I spent most of my time there listening to a book about zen buddhism.

{{< photo "japan/kyoto/ryoanji_zen_garden_6_small.jpg" "width" "zen garden" "It was a bit cold for much of the nature to have foliage." >}}

### kinkaku-ji (golden pavilion)

I also managed to check out the golden pavilion on the same day.

{{< photo "japan/kyoto/kyoto_golden_palace_small.jpg" "width" "golden pavilion" "The top two floors are coated in gold leaf." >}}

### nijo castle

Afterwards, I met up with Jade, Maxi and Oscar to check out Nijo Castle.

{{< photo "japan/kyoto/nijo_castle_ninomaru_palace_small.jpg" "width" "ninomaru palace" "Ninomaru Palace within the Nijo Castle grounds." >}}

### local park

We then took a little walk through the nearby park.

## osaka

After getting our cultural fix, we went to Osaka, which I would describe as Tokyo's edgier and cooler cousin. People smoked on the street here, and it was a little grungier in general.

### dotonbori

Dotonbori is the main area to spend time in Osaka and for good reason. It's full of restaurants, shops and people and is an absolute visual overload.

### mittera kaikan (bar block)

One of my favourite discoveries in my entire Asia journey so far has been Mittera Kaikan, a block full of bars that looks rather innocuous from the outside. The complex features over 60 unique bars, all seating only around 5-10 people.

The photos I captured of this bar were sadly underexposed so they've got a bit of grain to them. I also regrettably didn't get any photos of the insides of the bars.

{{< photo "japan/osaka/mittera_kaikan_small.jpg" "width" "bar doors" "You never know what the bar is like until you open the door." >}}
{{< photo "japan/osaka/mittera_kaikan_10_small.jpg" "width" "mittera kaikan" "A lot of the halls look like a tenant building and it's unclear if you're welcome to take a look around. But you are." >}}
{{< photo "japan/osaka/mittera_kaikan_2_small.jpg" "width" "guitar" "There's a big focus on alternative at a lot of these places." >}}
{{< photo "japan/osaka/mittera_kaikan_3_small.jpg" "width" "corkboard" "Each bar has its own aesthetic, such as this one with a corkboard wall out the front? I'm guessing they serve a bit of wine here." >}}

### osaka castle

Just to tick it off, we made a visit to Osaka Castle. It was a decent visit, and it also featured a mini-museum of plastic figurines.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/osaka_castle_small.jpg" "width" "osaka castle" "The main tower of Osaka Castle." >}}

### nara park

I know Nara Park is actually in Nara, not Osaka, but I feel most people visit here as a day trip from Osaka. We got to meet and feed the hungry deer, who aren't shy at all. They'll even nip on your bum to demand a feed.

{{< photo "japan/mobile_photos/jade_with_deer_small.jpg" "width" "nara park" "Jade with his new friends." >}}

Japan has been an absolute highlight of our Asia trip, and even if I am sad to see Maxi and Oscar leave back home, it was nice to experience the country together. 

Time to continue on to South Korea.
