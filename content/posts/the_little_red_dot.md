We spent four days in Singapore, which is sometimes referred to by its nickname the little red dot. I found it to be a clean, safe city that lacks spontaneity, but is an efficient marvel.

## gardens by the bay

We visited Gardens by the Bay, the cornerstone of Singapore's tourism industry, which is a must-see if you're visiting the city.

## cloud forest

Nearby is Cloud Forest which is a large enclosed greenhouse. It was much cooler inside so it was a welcome reprieve from the heat of outside.

Sadly we had to make the choice between Cloud Forest or another area of the park called Flower Dome as the entrance fees for both were exorbitant.

## singapore zoo

We spent one of our days visiting the Singapore Zoo, supposedly one of the best in the world. Already warmed up by the aviary back in Indonesia, we opted not to visit their bird sanctuary, and just see the classic zoo fare: giraffes, lions, tigers, you get it.

## joo chiat road

One of the highlights was Joo Chiat Road, on which we were staying. The street is known for it's Peranakan shophouses, which blend Malaysian, Chinese and European architectural styles. Walking through the streets, you can see various buildings with cracked tiling, carved shutters and bright popping colours of mango yellow and bright pink.

## christmas time

We wound up timing Singapore so we'd be there for Christmas.

## singapore changi airport

One of the funny things about Singapore is that their airport is one of their main attractions. We saw the Rain Vortex fountain, which is an impressive circular waterfall that centrepins the shopping complex.

Would I go back? Sure, for a layover. But give me Jakarta's chaos any day.
