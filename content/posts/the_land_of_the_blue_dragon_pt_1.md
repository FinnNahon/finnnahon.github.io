We've made it to 'Nam.

It's good to be back, and it has been interesting revisiting this city that I had seen a few years prior with new eyes.

## ho chi minh city

We spent one of our first evenings in the city going on a food tour. Whilst it was an enjoyable time, it was a little underwhelming as they showed us foods we were both already quite familiar with - bun bo hue, rice paper rolls, banh mi. The highlight for me were these leaf wrapped meat rolls which was paired with a delicious peanut satay-like sauce.

### no 14 ton that dam

My favourite thing about Ho Chi Minh City was an apartment complex simply called No. 14 Ton That Dam, which was just its address. A similar, more popular spot to go to nearby is the 'Cafe Apartments', but I found this a little over-touristy, whereas this was spot was perfect for me.

### railway walk

One afternoon, I decided to follow a self-guided walking tour alongside the railway in HCMC, which was a nice way to get acquainted with some of the lesser known streets in the city.

### the cafe apartments

Myself and Walid spent a little bit of time checking out the Cafe Apartments, however I wasn't terribly impressed and found it overly touristy.

## can tho

After Ho Chi Minh City, we decided to go on a bit of a Mekong Delta journey before reaching Cambodia, and our first stop was a town called Can Tho. 

### floating market boat tour

We stayed in a homestay with a lovely woman called Ms. Ha who woke us up early (around 5.30am) to take us on a floating market boat tour.
