We've made it to 'Nam.

It's good to be back, and it has been interesting revisiting this city that I had seen a few years prior with new eyes.

## ho chi minh city

We spent one of our first evenings in the city going on a food tour. Whilst it was an enjoyable time, it was a little underwhelming as they showed us foods we were both already quite familiar with - bun bo hue, rice paper rolls, banh mi. The highlight for me were these leaf wrapped meat rolls which were paired with a delicious peanut satay-like sauce.

### no 14 ton that dam

My favourite thing about Ho Chi Minh City was an apartment complex simply called No. 14 Ton That Dam, which was just its address. A similar, more popular spot to go to nearby is the 'Cafe Apartments', but I found this a little over-touristy, whereas this was spot was perfect for me.

### railway walk

One afternoon, I decided to follow a self-guided walking tour alongside the railway in HCMC, which was a nice way to get acquainted with some of the lesser known streets in the city.

### the cafe apartments

Myself and Walid spent a little bit of time checking out the Cafe Apartments, however I wasn't terribly impressed and found it overly touristy.

## can tho

After Ho Chi Minh City, we decided to go on a bit of a Mekong Delta journey before reaching Cambodia, and our first stop was a town called Can Tho. 

### floating market boat tour

We stayed in a homestay with a lovely woman called Ms. Ha who woke us up early (around 5.30am) to take us on a floating market boat tour.

### rice paper making

On this same tour, we were taken to a rice paper factory where we learnt how to prepare rice paper, run them through a flattening machine and dry them on some sun racks.

## sa dec

Our next stop along the Mekong was to visit Sa Dec, a town known for its flower farms.

### staying in a flower farm

We stayed at Maison en Bambou Phong-Le Vent, a homestay right in the middle of a bunch of flower farms, which was a perfect way to get immersed in what the town is known for.

### xeo quyt forest

We visited the Xeo Quyt Forest for a day, which is a 52-hectare mangrove forest that also has a history of being a base used by the Vietnamese during the Vietnam war.

We drove our motorbikes there, and had to hop across the Mekong river on a ferry.

## chau doc

Our final stop along the Vietnam Mekong was the town Chau Doc, right near the border with Cambodia.

Whilst here, Jade and I become friends with a guy called Rob who also happened to live in Fitzroy North, only minutes away from where me and Jade's previous sharehouse was. Pretty crazy coincidence. 

It was good to chat shit with him and talk about how Queen's Parade (a street in Clifton Hill) is a pretty crap place to go out. We talked about home for a little while, and he told us he was ending his journey soon and heading back home to start a family with his partner. A nice little surprised on the border.

### tra su cajuput forest

The main draw near Chau Doc is the Tra Su Cajuput Forest, which is a huge ecosystem spanning 850 hectares which plenty of waterways to take boats down.

Finally, we had to make the call to take a boat up the river into Cambodia. We'll be back soon enough to continue our second leg of Vietnam.
