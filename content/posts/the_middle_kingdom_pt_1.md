It was time to tackle one of the largest and most exciting countries on our journey, the People's Republic of China. We began by entering mainland china via Gongbei Port in Zhuhai before making our way to Guangzhou.

## guangzhou

We spent a few days in Guangzhou exploring the streets, particularly the streets surrounding Shangxiajiu Pedestratian Street, as there were many fashion shops for seemingly 'boutique' labels.

### whole chicken hotpot

We went out for some chicken hotpot, and much to our surprise, that meant we were getting an *entire* chicken.

### local market

I went for a stroll and wound up at a local market where they were selling all kinds of goods.

## zhangjiejae

We took a train and then a taxi from Guangzhou to Zhangjiajae, which is located in the Hunan province. As we arrived in the afternoon, by the time we had settled down in our hostel, it was becoming dark. 

After avoiding the strange man near our accomodation who kept trying to sell us a 'massage', we walked into town, which was lit up in various shades of yellow and orange. We suspected it was due to the approaching Chinese New Year.

### zhangjiejae national forest park

The reason why we came here was Zhangjiejae National Forest Park, which may be known by Westerners for inspiring the look of the film Avatar.

The park features many pillar formations that dot the landscape which have been formed over many years through erosion. We took the Bailong Elevator up to the top, and then spent a good few hours walking around.

### tianmen mountain

Despite coming here for the national park, what really wowed us was Tianmen Mountain. We took a cable car up, which took about 30 minutes. No chance of us climbing that, especially in the brisk weather.

## chongqing

After a few days in Zhangjiejae, we made the move to our first Chinese megacity, Chongqing. The built up area of the city has around 9.5 million people, but the entire municipality has over 32 million people living here.

Naturally, we had to stop by the building which is famous for having a train run through the middle of it.

### dongshuimen bridge and hongya cave

It's pretty hard to avoid Dongshuimen bridge (and the accompanying Qiansimen bridge) when walking through Chongqing.

Hongya Cave is probably **the** thing to visit whilst visiting Chongqing. It's multiple levels of food stalls and shops and it's absolutely bonkers inside.

### chongqing hotpot

A visit to Chongqing wouldn't be complete without having tried their hotpot, which is influenced heavily by Sichuan cuisine. This means a lot of chillies, and plenty of sichuan peppers. 

I had experienced what sichuan peppers were like in Hong Kong, but here it was another level. Just for context, sichuan peppers impart a sensation of numbness on your lips and mouth, which supposedly helps with eating larger amounts of chillies.

We were provided with an arrangement of meat, eggs, vegetables and noodles to put into the hotpot, and whilst it was delicious, I was definitely paying for it the next morning.

### ciqikou ancient town

One of our final stops was to visit Ciqikou, which is referred to Little Chongqing. Walking down the streets here, you'll find many wooden houses, teahouses, shops and temples. The town also has a history of porcelain production, so if that's your thing you'll have a good time.

I have split up my posts about China into two, as they'll be prohibitively long otherwise. 

That's it for our time in Chongqing. Next, we're onto Xi'an. You can continue reading <a href="/posts/the_middle_kingdom_pt_2" style="text-decoration: none; color: #dc143c;">here.</a>
