I am now in possession of a Fujifilm XT-5, which I will be using with a Fujifilm XF 16-55mm f2.8 zoom lens. 

I chose this lens specifically as it is dynamic and can be utilised for both street photography and landscape. *Apparently* the glass is as good as a prime lens, so we'll see.

<ins>Here's a couple test run photographs:</ins>
