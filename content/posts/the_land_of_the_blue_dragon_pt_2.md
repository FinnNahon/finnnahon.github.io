After spending a few extra days in Ho Chi Minh City, Jade and I decided to take a bus up to Da Lat, a city about 330 kms north-east which is known for its cooler climate due to being a part of the Central Highlands region of Vietnam.

## da lat

You'll notice that there is a lot of greenery and pine trees in the pictures going forward.

### riding through the pines

I decided to rent out a motorbike and take a ride up along the pine forests that litter the landscape up in the northern part of Da Lat. I spent a good four or five hours riding and it was quite peaceful.

## hoi an

After spending a few days in Da Lat, we ventured up to Hoi An, a city in central Vietnam that is known for its ancient town, which is full of yellow painted buildings. I didn't get my camera out whilst I was there, so sadly I do not have any pictures of the place.

### my son sanctuary

However, I did get pictures of the My Son sanctuary, which is full of temples made by the Cham people between the 4th and 13th centuries.

### craft villages

We also popped by a pottery village and a woodworking village and got to see the locals produce their crafts.

## phong nha

Now, me and Jade did visit both Da Nang and Hue as we made our way up Vietnam, but they weren't particularly notable apart from us spending one day attempting the Hai Van Pass and getting completely soaked on the way back. This was at night as well, and since the ground was so hot from the sun, when the rain hit the tarmac it created a sort of steam mist that covered the entire road.

Anyway, we made it to Phong Nha, which is a town in northern Vietnam that is known for its limestone mountains and huge caves.

### paradise cave

I would have loved to have seen Son Doong Cave here, the largest cave in the world. However, it was prohibitively expensive. So I saw a few others, including Paradise Cave, one of the most popular sights here.

{{< photo "vietnam/phong_nha/textured_cave_walls_small.jpg" "width" "rocks" "There we go." >}}

### the duck stop

We checked out the Duck Stop in Phong Nha, which was a silly but fun side quest that just involved hanging out with a ton of ducks and feeding them.

## ninh binh

After a few days in Phong Nha, we made our way to another scenic province in Vietnam called Ninh Binh.

### trang an scenic landscape complex

We took a boat tour through Trang An, which is a huge area full of limestone landscapes and valleys with rivers running throughout.

### thung nham bird park

We made a visit to Thhung Nham Bird Park, a sanctuary that covers 18km² and is a refuge for over 50,000 birds, of which there are 40 or more species.

## hanoi

After getting our nature fix, we hit the capital city of Vietnam, Hanoi. It's a bustling city that with a lot of life that, compared to Ho Chi Minh City, feels more dense and labyrinthian.

### hanoi train street

Arguably the most famous place to visit is Hanoi's train street, which is known for - you guessed it - a street with a train that runs down the middle of it. It's an absolute tourist trap, but it's amusing to visit.

{{< photo "vietnam/hanoi/hanoi_train_street_small.jpg" "width" "train street" "When the train isn't passing through, people walk about everywhere." >}}

### lideco bac 32

We made a quick visit to Lideco Bac 32, a partially abandoned estate of residential buildings that for some reason has been left to just sit. You can explore the apartment shells and it's a pretty unusual place.

### eating cha ca

One of my favourite dishes I had in Hanoi was Cha Ca, which is catfish marinated in turmeric, which is cooked in a pan alongside dill and spring onions. You'll typically eat it with vermicelli noodles, peanuts and a shrimp paste-like sauce. It's a strong flavour, but I like strong flavours.

## ha long

We were unsure if we should make a visit to Ha Long, but decided we might as well as it is one of the most famous places in all of Vietnam, or even Asia.

### ha long bay

We took a boat through the bay, which was quite comfortable as there was plenty of space. The day itself was pretty hot, but thankfully there was no rain.

## ha giang

One of our final destinations in Vietnam, Ha Giang is a province in northern Vietnam that borders China and is known for its beautiful landscapes and cooler weather.

### ha giang 4 day motorcycle loop

We decided to do a 4 day motorcycle loop in Ha Giang, a popular tourist trip that everyone who had done it said was their 'favourite thing they have done in Vietnam'. This immediately make me skeptical.

{{< photo "vietnam/ha_giang/jade_vietnam_flag_small.jpg" "width" "jade in ha giang" "Ha Giang was very bright." >}}

The entire group of people who were part of our tour company (Mama's Homestay) numbered what seemed to be about 60 people. However, we all got put into smaller groups of 5 - 8, and they became our crew for the 4 day journey.

I was skeptical, but Ha Giang delivered and it's one of the best experiences I've had whilst travelling. I'd definitely do it again.

## sa pa

Our final stop in Vietnam - Sa Pa. A mountainous region at the top of the country.

### fansipan mountain

One of the main draws of Sa Pa is Fansipan, the highest peak in all of Southeast Asia at 3,143 meters. People often spend 1-2 days trekking up, but I opted for the cable car as it was rainy and considered rather dangerous, especially without proper preparation.

### cat cat village

I visited Cat Cat Village, but this little village felt more like it was purely for visitors as they had a ticketed system and entrance fee and all that. It was cute, but felt artificial.

### hmong village

My favourite thing we did in Sa Pa was take a tour to a nearby Hmong village (a proper one, not like Cat Cat). We were assisted by one of the women from the village who spoke good English, and she would answer all of our questions.

I asked her about the local custom of 'bride kidnapping' where a man would kidnap a woman for 3 days and keep her in his house, during which time she can say yes or no to his marriage proposal. She confirmed it happens, and even expressed a level of sadness that she had never been kidnapped. I'm not sure how I feel about this custom.
