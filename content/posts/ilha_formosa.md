Ah, Taiwan. One of the places I look back on most fondly.

Arriving from South Korea, we took the train from the airport to our accomodation in Taipei, the capital of the country. 

The streets here reminded me of some Chinese cities, but with a more expressive and open atmosphere. There was still the messy streets, the smell of street food stalls and the density of other megacities, but people seemed more relaxed and welcoming.

Our first port of call was to get some food, so we sat down at a street-side restaurant and had a meal and a beer before deciding to walk through the city.

## taipei

We decided to do the Elephant Mountain trail, and at the top we had a pretty good view of Taipei 101, the most famous skyscraper in the city.

We took a detour from Elephant Mountain's trail and found some funny looking statues at a temple called Songshan Tianbao, including this guy.

I also spent an afternoon riding around the city on the rentable bicycles littered through the city, and spent a good while on the bike path alongside the river.

One evening, Jade and I went to Raohe Night Market to try some local foods. A highlight were these black pepper buns that are cooked in the inner wall of a clay brick oven.

We visited a place called Modern Toilet Restaurant for lunch once. The whole idea is they serve food in little toilet bowls. We weren't sure if we should visit this admittedly tacky concept of a restaurant, but the food was actually decent.

### houtong cat village

We took the train to Houtong Cat Village, which is a town most tourists visit on the way to Jiufen, another famous tourist town.

### jiufen old street

After visiting the cat village, we continued on to Jiufen and walked down the lantern-adorned alleyways. Once again, I failed to adjust my camera's exposure setting and so quite a few of these pictures are dark.

### chiang kai-shek memorial hall

The most impressive structure to visit in Taipei is, of course, the Memorial Hall. It's very well looked after, and larger than the pictures make it out to be.

### shrimp fishing

The most unusual thing we got up to in Taipei was spending an evening fishing for shrimp in an indoor pool. You essentially post up, grab a beer, cast your line and wait for a nibble. Then you get to eat whatever you catch.

We did also manage to make it to Tainan, a city south of Taipei, but we weren't there for very long and I didn't take any pictures whilst we were there. A delightful place, however.

Having spent a good amount of time in dense cities, we were due for more of a 'vacation'. Time to catch a flight and relax on a beach in the Philippines.
