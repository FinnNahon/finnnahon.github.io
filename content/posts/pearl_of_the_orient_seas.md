Our first stop in the Philippines was Manila, the capital city. A sprawling metropolis, it was quite built up, chaotic and not exactly the loveliest place. However, we were only there for a few days as it's often used a launchpad before heading to other parts of the country.

After a couple of days loitering around Manila, we hopped on an overnight ferry to Coron, our first true destination.

The ferry ride was over 15 hours long, but it was honestly not that rough of a ride as we got to sleep for a large portion of it. During the evening, I checked out the back of the ship and found a performance hall with some singers covering pop classics and ended up dancing with a bunch of other travellers!
