My first impression upon landing in Singapore was the stark contrast from Indonesia. The things I had gotten used to, such as street-side stalls, minefields of potholes and general chaos, were replaced with clean sidewalks, calm roads and a general sense of hyper-efficiency. I would initially be impressed with how well run the city is, but would come to regard the city as far too orderly and lacking any sense of spontaneity.

## nanny state qualms

Singapore is oft described as a nanny-state, born out of 'benevolent dictatorship' leadership by the country's People's Action Party and its head Lee Kuan Yew. There are countless rules and legalities you have to be aware of. Forget to flush a toilet? That's a fine. Chew gum? That's a fine (technically you can chew nicotine gum from a pharmacy, as long as you dispose of it properly). You can also receive corporal punishment, such as caning, for more serious offences. A little backwards for a country that is supposedly so forward-thinking. Get caught with weed? They'll hang you - okay, maybe not you specifically, but some poor bastard.

Singapore has its own historical reasons for its intensity in managing its citizens, and within a single generation, it turned itself from a port city slum into a brimming metropolis, so maybe they've got some things right. That being said, I found its nature overbearing and teetering on the edge of clinical.

## gardens by the bay

We visited Gardens by the Bay, the cornerstone of Singapore's tourism industry, which is a must-see if you're visiting the city. The steel trees that punctuate the park have foliage and flowers snaking up the towers; a noticeable blend of the constructed and the natural. You can see the famous Marina Bay Sands building in the background, a bit of an odd building that has multiple restaurants inside, as well a casino and a rooftop infinity pool. It's fitting that a hyper-orderly city such as Singapore would construct a completely artificial garden.

## cloud forest

Nearby is Cloud Forest which is a large enclosed greenhouse with throngs of greenery showcasing the flora and fauna of Singapore's limited environment. It was much cooler inside so it was a welcome reprieve from the heat of outside. I was impressed by the flowers they had on display inside.

Sadly we had to make the choice between Cloud Forest or another area of the park called Flower Dome as the entrance fees for both were exorbitant. Apparently the flower displays in there are some of the best in the world. Singapore is not a place for a thrifty backpacker to stay in for long. Luckily there isn't a lot to see there either. We were asked by one of the staff at our hostel how long we were planning to stay in Singapore. After we told him 4 days, he quipped that it was plenty.

## singapore zoo

We spent one of our days visiting the Singapore Zoo (supposedly one of the best in the world). Already warmed up by the aviary back in Indonesia, we opted not to visit their bird sanctuary, and just see the classic zoo fare - giraffes, lions, tigers, you get it.

## chinatown complex food centre

We visited the Chinatown Complex Food Centre, which is one of Singapore's famed hawker centres. Many suckers go to eat at Hawker Chan, a previously Michelin starred Cantonese roast meat restaurant. We were one of those suckers. It's a decent meal, but a far cry from what we expected. The real magic is at the other countless unmarked stalls - that's where you should be eating.

## joo chiat road

One of the highlights of my trip to Signapore was Joo Chiat Road, on which we were staying. The street is known for it's Peranakan shophouses, which blend Malaysian, Chinese and European architectural styles. Walking through the streets, you can see various buildings with cracked tiling, carved shutters and bright popping colours of mango yellow and bright pink.

## christmas time

We wound up timing Singapore so we'd be there for Christmas, and so we decided to head to one of the main streets, Orchard Road, to see what festivities were happening. The street and its shops were decked out with lights and decorations, and we caught a band playing South American flute music to the tune of Christmas songs. A little surreal, but fitting for such a hyper-commercialised holiday.

Afterwards, we went for karaoke with some friends we'd made at our hostel, which ended up being one of the most exorbitant singing sessions of my life, setting us back $50. The alcohol was also incredibly expensive, with $18 buying us the privilege of drinking Heineken. A little much to sing Wonderwall in a fluorescent box with a bunch of other sober strangers.

## singapore changi airport

Soon enough, we were due to fly out of Singapore to our next destination, Hong Kong. One of the funny things about Singapore is that their airport is one of their main attractions, with many of their own citizens planning a day to the airport to entertain themselves. We saw the Rain Vortex fountain, which is an impressive circular waterfall that centrepins the shopping complex. We wanted to see the butterfly enclosure as well, but we struggled to find it as it turns out it was behind immigration, and by the time we realised this, we had run out of time and had to rush to our gate.

Would I go back? Sure, for a layover. But give me Jakarta's chaos any day.
