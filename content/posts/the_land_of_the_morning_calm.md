We've arrived in South Korea, and boy is it cold. We've decided to start it off by staying in the Hongdae area of Seoul due to its proximity to nightlife. 

This may or may not have been a mistake.

## seoul

Seoul is an interesting city. It's quite busy and the nightlife is pretty bonkers, especially on the main bar streets. Our choice of staying at a party hostel was perhaps a misguided one, as we spent multiple nights getting blind and wasting the following day in bed. However, it was very social and we had made multiple friends to spend time with.

### bukchon hanok village

I visited Bukchon Hanok Village, which is a residential area in Seoul with multiple traditional Korean houses. Most of these houses are used by actual residents. I can't imagine having my house be a tourist attraction.

### constitutional court protest

After visiting Bukchon Hanok Village, I was walking back to the train station and accidentally wound up in a protest outside the constitutional court. Turns out these protesters were *pro* the president who tried to stage a coup. I did not want to stick around long, but found the contrast of the protest and tourists wearing traditional clothing to be interesting.

### gyeongbokgung palace

I didn't take many photos inside of the palace, but this is considered the main tourist attraction of the city. It's also the birthplace of hangul, the lettering system of the Korean language.

### korean bbq

Would a trip to South Korea be complete without some Korean BBQ?

### dmz

I took a trip outside Seoul to visit the DMZ like a lot of tourists do. It was a bit eerie being able to see across the landscape to see the hermit kingdom, but the tour I went on was a little dull. We did get to go underground into one of North Korea's infamous tunnels they built in the 70s, which was something.

## suwon

Jade and I took a day trip to Suwon to check out the Suwon Hwaesong Fortress.

## gyeongju

After experiencing Seoul for a little while, we travelled down to Gyeongju to visit some historical sights.

### daereungwon burial mounds

We visited these burial mounds, which are tumulus mounds that function as tombs. Many of them contain various artifacts, including plenty of ancient jewellery.

### woljeonggyo

This bridge was originally built in 760 CE, but was only reopened back in 2018. It also looks pretty at night.

### yangdong folk village

We also visited a Korean folk village which was founded in the 15th century during the Joseon period. It features a lot of thatched-roof houses and the residents here attempt to preserve their local customs.

## busan

We visited Busan, our final stop before heading back to Seoul, which is the second largest city in South Korea.

### gamcheon culture village

We spent a day visiting Gamcheon Culture Village, which is a maze of coloured buildings, with many having a focus on arts and culture.

### duf coffee

My favourite part of Gamcheon! And one of the highlights of South Korea in general. DUF Coffee is the most bonkers and unique cafe I have ever been to.

### haedong yonggungsa

### drone light show

One evening, we checked out the Busan drone light show, which was pretty impressive. Whilst the following is just a picture, the figures that were made in the sky were moving.

That's it for Busan. 

After looping back to Seoul and spending a few more days there, we decided to move onto our next country, Taiwan.
