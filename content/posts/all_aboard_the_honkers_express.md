Four days was enough in Singapore, now we're in Hong Kong. The city is chaotic, noisy, dirty and overwhelming. There are countless flashing neon signs, bikes and cars everywhere. I love it.

## building with bamboo

Hong Kong construction workers scaffold their buildings using bamboo, a practice that is apparently unique to this part of the world and is by turn much prettier than rusty poles of steel. It's also a sustainable practice, since bamboo grows incredibly fast and is a strong, reliable material.

## dai pai dongs

We visited a few *dai pai dongs*, which is a type of open-air food stall that is famous in Hong Kong. Sadly, only 17 dai pai dongs still exist as the government is no longer issuing new licenses.

We visited Lantau Island and took the cable car across to the island to see the Big Buddha.

## the peak tram and city skyline

We took the famous peak tram up to see Hong Kong's skyline as sunset set over the city.

## new year's eve

We spent NYE crammed against thousands of other people near the pier, and we didn't even get to see the fireworks due to our spot in the crowd. We all had fun anyhow.

Time for us to make our way to Asia's gambling mecca, Macau.
