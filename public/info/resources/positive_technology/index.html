Instead of focusing on the corrosive side of technology, which is easy to do, I thought I&rsquo;d highlight a few positive examples.

  
      
          Technology
          Positive Impact
      
  
  
      
          OpenStreetMap
          Provides accessible mapping data for everyone, enabling better navigation and community planning.
      
      
          Signal
          Ensures secure and private communication, protecting user data and promoting safe conversations.
      
      
          Butterfly iQ
          Provides portable ultrasound technology that democratizes access to medical imaging, allowing healthcare providers to deliver timely care in underserved areas.
      
      
          Regrow
          Utilizes satellite imagery and data analytics to help farmers optimize their practices, promoting sustainable agriculture and improving crop yields.
      
      
          Tor
          Enhances online privacy and security by allowing users to browse the internet anonymously, protecting freedom of expression in repressive environments.
      
      
          Tails
          A security-focused operating system that protects user anonymity by running from a USB stick, ideal for sensitive information handling.
      
      
          Toosheh
          Satellite filecasting technology, deployed in Iran and the Middle East, employs standard satellite equipment to deliver digital content without needing Internet access. This innovation was developed as a response to Internet censorship in Iran.
      
      
          FrontlineSMS
          Allows activists to communicate and organize through SMS in regions with limited internet access, facilitating grassroots mobilization.
      
      
          GlobaLeaks
          A secure whistleblowing framework that allows organizations to create their own platforms for anonymous reporting of wrongdoing.
      
      
          SecureDrop
          An open-source platform that enables whistleblowers to submit documents securely to journalists, protecting their anonymity.
      
      
          ProtonMail
          An encrypted email service that protects user privacy, enabling secure communication for whistleblowers and activists.
      
      
          Watsi
          Crowdfunds medical care for individuals in need, making healthcare accessible to underserved populations.
      
      
          Citizen Lab
          Uses technology to research and expose government surveillance and censorship, advocating for digital rights.
      
      
          OpenMRS
          An open-source platform that provides customizable medical record systems for low-resource settings, improving patient care and data management.
      
      
          The Commons Project
          Focuses on creating an interoperable digital health record system, promoting patient control over their health data.
      
      
          Global Forest Watch
          Utilizes satellite technology to monitor forest health and deforestation, enabling communities to take action for forest conservation.
      
      
          Open Climate Data
          Facilitates the opening and sharing of large climate datasets and climate data models available around the world.
