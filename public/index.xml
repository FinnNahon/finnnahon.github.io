      <description>So we carry on. After finishing up in Chongqing, we hopped on a train to our next destination, Xi&amp;rsquo;an.&#xA;xi&amp;rsquo;an&#xD;#&#xD;Xi&amp;rsquo;an is most famous for its terracotta warriors that were discovered in 1974, amongst a few other attractions. This is not to say it is a small city, as it still boasts about 12 million people. Nowhere is small in China.&#xA;xi&amp;rsquo;an city wall&#xD;#&#xD;Our first attraction was actually the Xi&amp;rsquo;an City wall, which we chose to spend the entire day walking around.</description>

      <description>It was time to tackle one of the largest and most exciting countries on our journey, the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China. We began by entering mainland china via Gongbei Port in Zhuhai before making our way to Guangzhou.&#xA;guangzhou&#xD;#&#xD;We spent a few days in Guangzhou exploring the streets, particularly the streets surrounding Shangxiajiu Pedestratian Street, as there were many fashion shops for seemingly &amp;lsquo;boutique&amp;rsquo; labels.&#xA;Twilight sun hitting the concrete.</description>

      <description>We took the bus across the Lingding and Jiuzhou channels into nearby Macau to see what Asia&amp;rsquo;s gambling mecca was like.&#xA;impressive landmark replicas&#xD;#&#xD;The displays of extravagant wealth are pretty intense here, and no matter where you look, you can see a casino looming in the distance. They have replicas of many world landmarks, including Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower.&#xA;The Londoner.&#xD;Inside the Londoner.&#xD;Replica Eiffel tower outside the Parisian.</description>

      <description>Four days was enough in Singapore, now we&amp;rsquo;re in Hong Kong. The city is chaotic, noisy, dirty and overwhelming. There are countless flashing neon signs, bikes and cars everywhere. I love it.&#xA;A curved building in the center of Hong Kong.&#xD;Sprawling.&#xD;Many of the buildings look aged, in a way I appreciate the look of.&#xD;You&amp;#39;ll see alot of these red taxis around.&#xD;Sunshine down a walkway.&#xD;Neon sign for Mee and Gees, a famous thriftshop.</description>

      <description>We spent four days in Singapore, which is sometimes referred to by its nickname the little red dot. I found it to be a clean, safe city that lacks spontaneity, but is an efficient marvel.&#xA;gardens by the bay&#xD;#&#xD;We visited Gardens by the Bay, the cornerstone of Singapore&amp;rsquo;s tourism industry, which is a must-see if you&amp;rsquo;re visiting the city.&#xA;Gardens by the Bay.&#xD;The metal branches of the trees.</description>

      <description>So it begins. First stop, Indonesia.&#xA;View from the airplane.&#xD;To start off, we spent a leisurely two weeks in Bali. You can see where we visited below.&#xA;kuta&#xD;#&#xD;We started in Kuta as it was closest to the airport. As expected, Kuta was not very nice. A lot of concrete and it suffers from overtourism.&#xA;uluwatu&#xD;#&#xD;We decided to leave Kuta for somewhere more peaceful and settled on Uluwatu, down in the southern part of the island.</description>
