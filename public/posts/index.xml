      <description>We took the bus across the Lingding and Jiuzhou channels into nearby Macau to see what Asia&amp;rsquo;s gambling mecca was like.&#xA;impressive landmark replicas&#xD;#&#xD;The displays of extravagant wealth are pretty intense here, and no matter where you look, you can see a casino looming in the distance. They have replicas of many world landmarks, including Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower.&#xA;The Londoner.&#xD;Inside the Londoner.&#xD;Replica Eiffel tower outside the Parisian.</description>

      <description>Four days was enough in Singapore, now we&amp;rsquo;re in Hong Kong. The city is chaotic, noisy, dirty and overwhelming. There are countless flashing neon signs, bikes and cars everywhere. I love it.&#xA;A curved building in the center of Hong Kong.&#xD;Sunshine down a walkway.&#xD;Neon sign for &#34;Mee &amp; Gees&#34;, a famous thriftshop.&#xD;A light-adorned boat on the Hong Kong River.&#xD;Thumbs up for the Star Ferry.&#xD;building with bamboo&#xD;#&#xD;Hong Kong construction workers scaffold their buildings using bamboo, a practice that is apparently unique to this part of the world and is by turn much prettier than rusty poles of steel.</description>

      <description>We spent four days in Singapore, which is sometimes referred to by its nickname the little red dot. I found it to be a clean, safe city that lacks spontaneity, but is an efficient marvel.&#xA;gardens by the bay&#xD;#&#xD;We visited Gardens by the Bay, the cornerstone of Singapore&amp;rsquo;s tourism industry, which is a must-see if you&amp;rsquo;re visiting the city.&#xA;Gardens by the Bay.&#xD;The metal branches of the trees.</description>

      <description>Starting off our trip, we spent a leisurely two weeks in Bali. You can see where we visited below.&#xA;kuta&#xD;#&#xD;We started in Kuta as it was closest to the airport. As expected, Kuta was not very nice. A lot of concrete and it suffers from overtourism.&#xA;uluwatu&#xD;#&#xD;We decided to leave Kuta for somewhere more peaceful and settled on Uluwatu, down in the southern part of the island.</description>
