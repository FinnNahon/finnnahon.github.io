      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first impression upon landing in Singapore was the stark contrast from Indonesia. The things I had gotten used to, such as street-side stalls, minefields of potholes and general chaos, were replaced with clean sidewalks, calm roads and a general sense of hyper-efficiency. I would initially be impressed with how well run the city is, but would come to regard the city as far too orderly and lacking any sense of spontaneity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After two weeks in Bali, we had limited time on the island of Java. We started off spending a night in the coastal town of Banyuwangi. This was a quiet night as there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to do in the town and it was more of a stop-over. We stayed at a banana-themed hostel and had some food along the main strip near our place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next day, we hopped onto an 13-hour overnight bus from Banyuwangi to Yogyakarta, as the train tickets were all sold out. How bad can it be, right? Famous last words. The bus trip was initially fine in the evening, but we noticed that the bus would make at least one stop every 30 minutes, and that at every stop, sellers from the street would parade through the bus selling whatever it is they had to sell, be it food or trinkets. They weren&amp;rsquo;t quiet either, and one seller even brought his guitar onto the bus to perform for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have now been travelling for two weeks. &lt;ins&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where we&amp;rsquo;ve ended up so far:&lt;ins&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/bali_map.png&#34; alt=&#34;map&#34; width=&#34;750px&#34;/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-the-local-culture--religion&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  understanding the local culture &amp;amp; religion&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#understanding-the-local-culture--religion&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the first things we did was learn some basic phrases in both Bahasa Indonesian and Balinese. We felt a little guilty not using the locals language and ordering everything in English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First we learnt &lt;em&gt;terima kasih&lt;/em&gt;, which is Indonesian for thank you, and shortly after we decided to learn some more local phrases, and thus we started using both &lt;em&gt;om swastiastu&lt;/em&gt; (a Balinese greeting that translates roughly to &amp;lsquo;may god bless you&amp;rsquo;) and &lt;em&gt;suksma&lt;/em&gt; (which is Balinese for thank you). Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just my perception, but the locals eyes seemed to light up a little bit more when addressing them in their own language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-flight&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  the flight&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-flight&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a rather busy pre-trip month in Melbourne, we both made it to Melbourne Airport, bags packed and ready to go. No real hiccups at the airport, thankfully. After having a final goodbye pint of Carlton, we hopped onto the plane and began the 6-hour flight to Bali.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure style=&#34;display: inline-block; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/on_the_plane.jpg&#34; width=&#34;550px&#34; alt=&#34;On The Plane&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption style=&#34;display: block; text-align: center;&#34;&gt;I&#39;m travelling with this schmuck?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The view of the landscape over South Australia and the Northern Territory was pretty stunning, especially during twilight. What was a little frightening was as it hit nightfall, we saw many clouds in the middle of a lightning storm - seeing lighting from above is not something I had on my bingo card (you can see it in the video below, at around the 21s mark).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
